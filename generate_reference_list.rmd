References need to be in the Form (Author, Year) or (Author A, Year; Author B Year). 
The output will be a list of all references used. The outuput will be sorted alhabetically. Brackets that contain multiple references will be split up accordingly, i.e. the above example will generate two entries in the output. There will be no duplicates in the output.
The output will be given directly inside the notebook and also saved as a `txt` file.
